## Project Idea <a name="projectidea">
  One of the toughest parts of being a college student is the long hours of working at night and then having to wake up early for a lecture or lab. As more and more people use their cellphones for their original purpose and alarm, it has been discovered that around 68% of teenagers keep their phone within reach at night and 1/3 of teenagers sleep with their phones. This can definitely be an issue for people who tend to snooze their alarms or outright turn them off instead of actually standing up and going about their day. For this reason, our team decided that designing a remote clock with alarm that would move around the room until turned off would be benefitial for these types of people. With this device, the need to use cellphones as alarms would be greatly reduced resulting in less people using their cellphones in bed and in consequence sleeping with them.
